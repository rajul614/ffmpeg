Checkpoint #1
Install and Test ffmpeg 
Project weight: 5.0
Due during Week #7

This checkpoint is officially due on Friday, February 21 before the end of the day.  Students who complete this project on time have done C-level (average) work.  Excellence in learning and accomplishment will be demonstrated through timeliness:

Checkpoint requirements
Select a partner (required).  (The team programming guidelines and rules from assignment #4 remain in place.  Please review them.)

Review the project specifications and ffmpeg installation instructions. 

Download, install, and test ffmpeg.  One or both of the partners may install ffmpeg.  It is required that you change your ffmpeg directory permissions so that the directory is not accessible by other students.

If you and your partner would like to maintain separate files, please choose and use version control software on your own.  (You learned about this in CS 3500.)  I recommend Git, as you will use Git for cloning the ffmpeg source code.

Alter ffmpeg so that when it loads one type of image file, it prints out two lines like this to the screen:

    *** CS 3505:  Executing in (place function and file names here) ***
    *** CS 3505:  Altered by (place your names here) ***
  
For example, I changed ffmpeg so that whenever a .tiff image file was loaded, it printed out the above two lines to the console (with my information in them.)

You should choose exactly one type of file out of .jpg, .gif, .png, or .tiff.  Find the source code in ffmpeg that reads in this type of file, and alter it so that it prints out the required lines exactly once if a file of that type that is loaded.  If multiple files of that type are loaded, do not print out the information multiple times.

Confine your changes to a single .c file.  Also, take note of which library file gets modified when you change the source code file.

Clarification:  You must find the code that decodes the type of image, and modify it.  It is not sufficient to modify ffplay's main.  The goal is for you to find the code that actually processes images as they are read in.  (This helps you later on.)

Both partners should submit exactly three files:

Submit the .c file you modified.
Submit a one line text file named "location.txt" that contains the name of the directory where your modified file should be placed.  It should start with ffmpeg/ and end with the directory name where your .c file goes.  This file will be automatically parsed, so don't include other text of any kind.  Your file should just contain a valid partial pathname.
Submit a short text document titled "partner.txt".  In it, list your name and your partner's name.
